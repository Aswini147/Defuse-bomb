# Defuse-bomb
The task involved creating a countdown for a bomb. The goal? To defuse the bomb by entering the keyword 'defuse' into an input field before the countdown reaches zero. If successful, the bomb is defused; otherwise, well... you get the idea â€“ 'BOOM'! ðŸ’¥ 

To achieve this, I leveraged JavaScript callbacks and scheduler methods such as `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`. These methods allowed me to set up the countdown and manage it effectively.

Additionally, I utilized keyboard events and event listeners, employing a method called `addEventListener()`. This enabled me to listen for the 'Enter' key press and trigger the defusing process accordingly.
